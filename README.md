## ðŸ“– Abstract

Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) plays a critical role in domains such as manufacturing and infrastructure monitoring. In this work, we present **CARS-AD** and **ROADS-AD**, two challenging datasets with diverse, heterogeneous image content to evaluate AD algorithms rigorously.

- **CARS-AD**: Real images of cars exhibiting various defects.  
- **ROADS-AD**: Images of roads from multiple countries, presenting unique challenges for anomaly detection.

Both datasets include:  
- **Pixel-wise ground truth masks** for anomaly localization.  
- **Image-level labels** for anomaly detection benchmarking.  

We evaluate state-of-the-art unsupervised AD methods using the **AUROC metric** for detection and localization. Our results reveal significant room for improvement, emphasizing the need for robust and adaptable AD techniques.  

For more details, the paper will be available after publication. Stay tuned!
